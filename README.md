I created this repository just like a pet-project for testing my new knowledge.

***
How it basically works:
 - Message from *mailbox_1* send to *mailbox_2* (SMPT)
 - Get message from *mailbox_2* (IMAP)
 - Assert results
***

Note: On both accounts need to checkbox on gmail: "enable IMAP" and "Unsafe applications allowed"
